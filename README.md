# Dotfiles

* These are my personal dotfiles that i use in my day to day workflow.
* The neovim config in the repo is basically default nvChad flavour of neovim.

* For the zshrc I am using a default zsh with a few plugins and powerlevel10k theme to just fancy up my shell mostly.

* Tmux config is to set a few bindkeys and Dracula theme.
